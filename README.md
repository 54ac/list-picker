## The List Picking Thing

### What is this?

This is an extremely simple tool for picking one or more elements from a list. Written in vanilla Javascript, based on [Athlon's boilerplate](https://github.com/WeAreAthlon/frontend-webpack-boilerplate). Mostly for personal use.

### What's the point?

I needed something that could pick things for me, so I made it. Decision-making can be a difficult process sometimes.

### How do I use this?

1. Enter list (one entry per line),
2. Press the pick button.

### Where can I use this?

### How do I launch this myself?

1. `git clone https://github.com/rowrawer/list-picker.git .`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm start`
